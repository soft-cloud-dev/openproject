class WorkPackages::ProgressForm < ApplicationForm
  ##
  # Primer::Forms::BaseComponent or ApplicationForm will always autofocus the
  # first input field with an error present on it. Despite this behavior being
  # a11y-friendly, it breaks the modal's UX when an invalid input field
  # is rendered.
  #
  # The reason for this is since we're implementing a "format on blur", when
  # we make a request to the server that will set an input field in an invalid
  # state and it is returned as such, any time we blur this autofocused field,
  # we'll perform another request that will still have the input in an invalid
  # state causing it to autofocus again and preventing us from leaving this
  # "limbo state".
