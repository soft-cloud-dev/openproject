  # The value for derived_done_ratio had been calculated wrong in the past. So prior to executing the job
  # values in the work_packages and work_package_journals table sometimes contained wrong data.
  # The whole job/migration is now treating the derived_done_ratio as a value newly introduced even if it, under
  # the hood has existed before. But it was not shown in the activites before so the user would not have seen it.
  #
  # Because of this, all values, in the work_packages and work_package_journals table, for derived_done_ratio are
  # reset to null.
  #
  # This results in two cases:
  # * The value before has been something (most of the time 0) and is now null. This will hopefully be the
  #   majority of the cases as it would save a lot of journal creation, the slowest part of the job.
  #   For that case, the derived_done_ratio will be treated as not having changed by the job since with the rewrite
  #   the value looks to have been null before and is now null again.
  # * The value before has been something and is now something. It could have been the same value as before. But
  #   since the job resets the value to null, it will in every case be treated as having changed (set for the first time)
