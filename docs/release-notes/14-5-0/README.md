# OpenProject 14.5.0

Release date: 2024-09-11

We released OpenProject [OpenProject 14.5.0](https://community.openproject.org/versions/1411). The release contains several bug fixes and we recommend updating to the newest version. 

In these Release Notes, we will give an overview of important feature changes as well as breaking changes for developers. At the end, you will find a complete list of all changes and bug fixes.

## Important updates for Docker compose

The installation repository for Docker Compose has been moved to [https://github.com/opf/openproject-docker-compose](https://github.com/opf/openproject-docker-compose).

When updating, you will note that the repository now only contains the Docker compose setup, and the legacy Kubernetes deployment option has been removed. This means the folder structure has been changed slightly. No other changes are necessary. As we introduced a new local image starting in 14.4., the command to install and upgrade the Docker compose setup has been changed. Please double-check the [Docker compose installation guide](../../installation-and-operations/installation/docker/)Â on how to upgrade your installation.

If you are looking for an option to install OpenProject on Kubernetes, please use our [OpenProject Helm chart](../../installation-and-operations/installation/helm-chart/).

## Important feature changes

### Keep and restore local versions of WYSIWYG content changes

As of OpenProject 14.5, every WYSIWYG content change is saved locally so that you can restore it if the editor crashes (e.g. if you reload the page with unsaved changes). OpenProject uses WYSIWYG editors in work package descriptions, wikis and forums. To access the locally saved content of previous changes, click on the new icon we have added to the top of your editor. If there are unsaved changes to the content, you will see a drop-down list with the changes listed, each showing the time and word count of the respective content version.

![Example screenshot of a locally stored content version in WYSIWYG editor](openproject-14-5-wysiwyg-editor.png)

Please note that locally stored means that only you can see and restore your unsaved changes.

### Enable a storage for multiple projects at once

Admins responsible for storages in OpenProject can now save time by enabling a storage for multiple projects at once. A new **Enabled in projects** tab is added to the edit storage view. Here, admins see a list of all the projects that the storage is activated in. They can now add projects to the storage by clicking the green button **Add projects**. Here is an example of how this looks like for a Nextcloud file storage:

![Example screenshot of the admin page of a Nextcloud file storage, showing the 'Enabled in projects' tab](openproject-14-5-multiple-projects-to-storage.png)

This feature works for all [external file storages](../../system-admin-guide/files/external-file-storages/) that are currently possible with OpenProject.

### Export work package lists in an updated modal with additional settings

With OpenProject 14.5., we updated the modal for exporting work package lists. The new modal is more intuitive to use and has more options. It not only looks much better now, users can also export their work package list in form of a Gantt chart. Also, they can now select and reorder the columns to be displayed in the export directly in the modal.

### Release to Community: Display custom field columns/filters in project lists

From time to time an Enterprise add-on is released for the free community version. We are happy to announce that with OpenProject 14.5, custom field columns/filters can be displayed in project lists in all editions. This means that also Community users can now filter and sort their project lists using custom fields in order to create the best possible overview. 

### Updated user experience in the notification center

We did some design changes in the notification center, to improve your user experience. For example, the buttons **Unread**, **All** and **Mark all as read** are now placed on the left side, above your list of notifications.

### Use CloudFlare Turnstile as Captcha

In addition to reCAPTCHA, administrators can now use [CloudFlare Turnstile](https://developers.cloudflare.com/turnstile/) as Captcha. Cloudflare Turnstile is an alternative to Recaptcha that avoids user interaction. 

To use Cloudflare Turnstile with OpenProject, you need to configure the reCAPTCHA settings in the Cloudflare dashboard. Read more in our [system admin guide](../../system-admin-guide/authentication/recaptcha/).

> [!NOTE]
> A special Thanks goes to [Aaron Dewes](https://github.com/AaronDewes), the initiator and Community contributor for this feature. It is very much appreciated! ðŸ’™

### Improved filter search for custom project lists

Filtering and searching project lists has been improved with OpenProject 14.5: 

1. A fixed search field has been added so that you can quickly enter a project name and search for it.
2. When selecting a new filter, the project list below will immediately reload and display the selected filters.

See our user guide to learn more about [project lists and how to filter them](../../user-guide/projects/project-lists/#project-lists-filters).

### PDF export of meeting agenda and meeting

When pressing the key combination for printing â€“ e.g. **cmd + P** for mac users or **STRG + P** for Windows users â€“ you can create your meeting as PDF, download and print it. This has been improved with OpenProject 14.5, so that, for example, meeting buttons like **+ Add** are not displayed in the PDF.

### Meetings: Disable by default "Send out invitation emails upon creation"

When creating a new meeting in OpenProject, you can choose wheather you want to send out invitation emails or not. Up until now, this has been enabled by default. Due to user feedback, this option is now disabled per default.

### Rename actions in work package dropdown menu

We have renamed some of the actions in the work package dropdown menu. They should now be easier to understand and more intuitive to use for new users. Here is an overview of the renaming:

 Old name   | New name                                                     | 
 --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | 
 Change project   | Move to another project | 
 Copy             | Duplicate        |
 Copy to other project | Duplicate in another project |

## Breaking changes for developers

In this release, the dynamic bootstrapping of Angular components has been removed. Instead, use `Angular Elements` to define it as a custom element. See our [openproject-proto\_plugin prototypical plug-in](https://github.com/opf/openproject-proto_plugin) to see how to do that.
