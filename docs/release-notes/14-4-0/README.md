# OpenProject 14.4.0

Release date: 2024-08-14

We released [OpenProject 14.4.0](https://community.openproject.org/versions/2063). The release contains several bug fixes and we recommend updating to the newest version. 

In these Release Notes, we will give an overview of important technical updates as well as important feature changes. At the end, you will find a complete list of all changes and bug fixes.

## Important technical updates

### Extend API authentication to accept JWT issued by OpenID provider to other client

OpenProject 14.4 introduces a new feature that allows OpenID clients, such as Nextcloud servers, to use access tokens obtained from an OpenID provider, like Keycloak, as an authentication mechanism for the OpenProject API. This enhancement **enables users to skip the OAuth grant flow**, streamlining the authentication process.

With this feature, the OpenProject API will validate access tokens issued by the OpenID provider (Keycloak) by checking the token's signature and authenticating the user using the sub claim value. This integration ensures secure and efficient API authentication for OpenID clients.

For more details, take a look at our [API documentation](../../api/introduction/#oidc-provider-generated-jwt-as-a-bearer-token).

### Improve error messages and logs of automatically managed project folders synchronization services/jobs

OpenProject 14.4 introduces significant enhancements to logging, debugging, and error messages for automatically managed project folders synchronization services and jobs. These improvements aim to provide clearer messages and more detailed logs for both administrators and users.

Up to now, the system faced issues such as unclear error messages, insufficient log details, and a lack of localized error messages. To address these problems, **the system now provides context-specific error messages** instead of vague ones. For example, instead of "Outbound request destination not found," the system will now display messages like 'The file #{file_link.origin_name} was not found on #{storage_name}', which will also be localized to improve clarity.

Additionally, the logging structure has been enhanced to provide more detailed, tagged entries for better traceability.

For more details, see https://community.openproject.org/wp/56861.

## Important feature changes

### Personal settings: Dark mode

Dark mode for OpenProject is finally here! In the '[My account](../../getting-started/my-account/#profile-settings)' section under 'Settings', there is an **option labeled 'Mode' where users can now select 'Dark (Beta).'** â€“ as an alternative to the light mode. When the dark mode is selected, the change applies only to that user, not to the entire instance. 

![News setting for dark mode in OpenProject, displayed in dark mode](openproject-14-4-dark-mode.png)

Please note that this feature has been tested extensively, and we believe it works well. However, users might encounter issues that we haven't seen. Therefore, it will remain in beta for now, until we resolve all potential errors and ensure there are no issues.

For more details, see https://community.openproject.org/wp/36233.

### Project attributes: Separate permissions for viewing and editing

In OpenProject 14.4, new permissions for managing [project attributes](../../user-guide/projects/project-settings/project-attributes/) provide project admins with more control over who can view and edit these attributes.

The update adds **two new permissions: 'View project attributes' and 'Edit project attributes'**. 'View project attributes' is added to all roles, while 'Edit project attributes' is added to roles with the 'Edit project' permission.

![Screenshot showing the two newly added permissions for project attributes](openproject-14-4-project-attributes-permissions-highlighted.png)

Permissions are now independent, so users with 'Edit project' can lack the new permissions. Users without 'View project attributes' cannot see or search project attributes in the overview, settings, list, exports, API, or Schema API. Users without 'Edit project attributes' cannot modify these attributes but can view them if they have view permission.

For more details, see https://community.openproject.org/wp/50844.

### Status-based progress reporting: Freely input % complete values for statuses

We have improved the status-based progress indicator in OpenProject. As requested by some users, you can now **enter any percentage value in the "% Complete" field**, e.g. 9% or 73%, instead of being limited to 10% increments. Please note that only integer values between 1 and 100 are allowed, so decimal values or non-numeric inputs will not be accepted.

Here is an example of a new status that triggers a % Complete of 73%:

![Screenshot showing the OpenProject administration for a new status with % Complete 73%](openproject-14-4-status-percentage-complete.png)

For more details on status-based progress reporting, see our [system admin guide](../../system-admin-guide/manage-work-packages/work-package-status/).

### Nextcloud storages: Connection validation

Last month, we already released a connection validation feature for OneDrive/SharePoint storages. With OpenProject 14.4, we added a connection validation for Nextcloud storages. This feature allows administrators to **verify if the storage works as expected and provides helpful feedback if issues arise**. A new button enables the manual triggering of a connection test and validation of the Nextcloud storage settings. If an error occurs during the test, it will be displayed along with an explanation and helpful information.

![Screenshot of OpenProject's Connection validation for Nextcloud](openproject_file_storages_recheck_connection_nextcloud.png)

The validations include checking if the external storage server is reachable, verifying for SSL errors, ensuring the server is accessible, confirming that necessary apps are activated on Nextcloud and that their versions are compatible, and validating the app password.

Read more about connection validation for Nextcloud in our [system admin guide](../../system-admin-guide/files/external-file-storages/health-status/#connection-validation-for-nextcloud).

### Project lists: Select/Exclude projects in project list explicitly via filter

In OpenProject 14.4, users can now **explicitly select or exclude individual projects in the project list, using a filter**. This feature allows users to limit and refine their project lists more precisely. Within the filter section of the project list, there is a new filter called "Project." This filter supports the "is (OR)" and "is not" operators and allows selecting projects via an autocompleter with multiselect capability.

For example, you can filter your active projects by excluding certain projects:

![Screenshot of OpenProject 14.4, filtering project lists with 'Project' 'is not'](openproject-14-4-project-lists-filter.png)

For more details, see https://community.openproject.org/wp/55233.

### Meetings: Saving a new agenda item does not automatically add another empty one

In the past, when working with the meeting module in OpenProject, a new agenda item was automatically created as soon as a previous one was saved. This was originally built so that new items could be added to a meeting in quick succession. However, working with it has shown that often no new agenda item was needed at all - but, for example, a work package should be added or another change made. For this reason, OpenProject 14.4 has virtually reversed this feature: **saving a new agenda item no longer creates a new empty one**.

### Meetings tab on work packages: Display related meetings chronologically

In OpenProject 14.4, the **meetings tab within work packages now displays related meetings in chronological order**. This feature is designed for users who organize meetings and connect work packages with dynamic meetings, making it easier to see when a work package has been discussed.

For upcoming meetings, the tab will display them in chronological order with the nearest occurrence first and the most distant last. For past meetings, the tab will display them in reverse chronological order, with the most recent occurrence first and the oldest last.

### Design: Improve avatar color generation so that users with same names are distinguishable

Some users share the same name or create several accounts with the same name. To be able to tell them apart, e.g. when looking through search results for that name, we improved the avatar color generation, so that **users with the same name are displayed with different colors**. We recommend uploading an avatar image so that the distinction is even more obvious.

### Dropdown menu on work packages: Move "Copy link to clipboard" up

To avoid confusion with the "copy" or "copy to another project" actions, we have moved the "copy link to clipboard" action upwards in the drop-down menu for work packages. This action is now in third place in the work package table view. In the work package detail view, the action is now in first position.

![Detailed view of a work package, drop down menu with highlighted 'Copy link to clipboard'](openproject-14-4-copy-link.png)

### Add link to storage provider in storage edit view

To improve efficiency and access to file storages, OpenProject 14.4 allows administrators to click on a **direct link to the storage provider in the edit view of the storage**.

In the "General information" section, there is now a link that opens in a new window and leads to the root folder of the storage. For Nextcloud, this link refers to the root folder of the Nextcloud instance. For OneDrive/SharePoint, the link refers to the root folder of the drive ID and also works with "OneDrive Business".

See https://community.openproject.org/wp/56045 for more information on this feature.

### Show changes of long text custom fields in the activity similar to changes in the description

To keep the activity view cleaner when multiple changes are made to long text custom fields, OpenProject 14.4 now **displays updates to long custom fields in a similar format to description updates**. As a user watching the activity, you will see an indication of changes to long text custom fields, making it easier to manage and review activities.

In the activity tab, updates to long text custom fields will be displayed as in the following example â€“ 'Remarks' being a custom field:

![Example screenshot showing how changes on a custom field will now look like in the work package activity tab](Custom_field__long_text__changed.png)

Clicking on the "Details" link will take the user to the diff view, which is also used for work package descriptions and project status explanations. See our [user guide on custom fields](../../user-guide/projects/project-settings/custom-fields/) for more information.
