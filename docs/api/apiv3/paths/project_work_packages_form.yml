  summary: Form for creating Work Packages in a Project
  operationId: form_create_work_package_in_project
  tags:
    - Work Packages
  description: |-
    This endpoint allows you to validation a new work package creation body in a specific project. It works similarly
    to the `/api/v3/work_packages/form` endpoint, but already specifies the work package's project in the path, so that
    it does not have to be defined in the request body.
  parameters:
    - name: id
      description: ID of the project in which the work package will be created
      in: path
      required: true
      schema:
        type: integer
      example: '1'
  requestBody:
    content:
      application/json:
