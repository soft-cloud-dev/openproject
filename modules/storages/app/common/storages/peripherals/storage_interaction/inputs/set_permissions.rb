        # user_permissions - A list of user specific file permissions.
        # IMPORTANT: the user ids are considered to be the ids of the remote identities. If user permissions should be
        # set via a group, a `group_id` must be provided instead of a `user_id`.
        #   Example:
        #     [
        #       {user_id: "d6e00f6d-1ae7-43e6-b0af-15d99a56d4ce", permissions: [ :read_files,
        #                                                                        :write_files,
        #                                                                        :create_files,
