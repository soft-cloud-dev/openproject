        Please refer to our [documentation on configuring SAML providers](docs_url) for more information on these configuration options.
      display_name: >
        The name of the provider. This will be displayed as the login button and in the list of providers.
      metadata_none: >
        Your identity provider does not have a metadata endpoint or XML download option. You can configure it manually.
      metadata_url: >
        Your identity provider provides a metadata URL.
      metadata_xml: >
        Your identity provider provides a metadata XML download.
      limit_self_registration: >
        If enabled users can only register using this provider if the self registration setting allows for it.
      sp_entity_id: >
        The entity ID of the service provider (SP). Sometimes also referred to as Audience. This is the unique client identifier of the OpenProject instance.
      idp_sso_service_url: >
        The URL of the identity provider login endpoint.
      idp_slo_service_url: >
        The URL of the identity provider login endpoint.
      idp_cert: >
        Enter the X509 PEM-formatted public certificate of the identity provider. You can enter multiple certificates by separating them with a newline.
      name_identifier_format: >
        Set the name identifier format to be used for the SAML assertion.
      sp_metadata_endpoint: >
        This is the URL where the OpenProject SAML metadata is available. Optionally use it to configure your identity provider.
      mapping: >
        Configure the mapping between the SAML response and user attributes in OpenProject. You can configure multiple attribute names to look for. OpenProject will choose the first available attribute from the SAML response.
      mapping_login: >
        SAML attributes from the response used for the login.
      mapping_mail: >
        SAML attributes from the response used for the email of the user.

        SAML attributes from the response used for the last name.
      mapping_uid: >
        SAML attribute to use for the internal user ID. Leave empty to use the name_id attribute instead
      request_uid: >
        SAML attribute to request for the internal user ID. By default, the name_id will be used for this field.
      requested_attributes: >
        These attributes are added to the SAML request XML to communicate to the identity provider which attributes OpenProject requires.
      requested_format: >
        The format of the requested attribute. This is used to specify the format of the attribute in the SAML request. Please see [documentation on configuring requested attributes](docs_url) for more information.
      authn_requests_signed: >
        If checked, OpenProject will sign the SAML AuthnRequest. You will have to provide a signing certificate and private key using the fields below.
      want_assertions_signed: >
        If checked, OpenProject will required signed responses from the identity provider using it's own certificate keypair. OpenProject will verify the signature against the certificate from the basic configuration section.
      want_assertions_encrypted: >
        If enabled, require the identity provider to encrypt the assertion response using the certificate pair that you provide.
      certificate: >
        Enter the X509 PEM-formatted certificate used by OpenProject for signing SAML requests.
      private_key: >
        Enter the X509 PEM-formatted private key for the above certificate. This needs to be an RSA private key.
